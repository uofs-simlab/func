 * Before beginning, we recommend reading the Readme.md on FunC's GitHub.  This
 * includes some basic theory of LUTs, a use case, some important classes, and
 * the installation guide.  We cannot easily include Readme.md in this user
 * manual because Doxygen uses a syntax for equations that is incompatible with
 * LaTeX and GitHub Markdown.
